# Implementing-YOLO
YOLO is an extremely fast real time multi object detection algorithm. YOLO stands for “You Only Look Once”. 

The algorithm applies a neural network to an entire image. The network divides the image into an S x S grid and comes up with bounding boxes, which are boxes drawn around images and predicted probabilities for each of these regions. The method used to come up with these probabilities is logistic regression. The bounding boxes are weighted by the associated probabilities. For class prediction, independent logistic classifiers are used.
